# Kwesiada Frankaa (Tic-Tac-Toe)

This is a simple toy implementation of the variant of the tic-tac-toe game I used to play as a child. I implemented toy versions of this particular game in most programming languages I have learnt, including Basic, C/C++, VBForms, WPF C#, **HTML/JS** and ReactJS, as my little version of a hello world.

This was written over a decade ago, back in high school, when I was first learning web development; before I knew about version control and Git.
